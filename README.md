# Self-Paced-JavaScript

## Introduction

- JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is well-suited to object-oriented and functional programming styles.
- JavaScript’s variables are untyped. Its syntax is loosely based on Java, but the languages are otherwise unrelated.
- JavaScript derives its first-class functions from Scheme and its prototype based inheritance from the little-known language Self.
- JavaScript has long since outgrown its scripting-language roots to become a robust and efficient general-purpose language suitable for serious software engineering and
  projects with huge codebases.

*Note* : Except for a superficial syntactic resemblance, JavaScript is completely different from the Java programming language.

## History of JavaScript
- JavaScript was created at Netscape in the early days of the web, and technically, “JavaScript” is a trademark licensed from Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) used to    
  describe Netscape’s (now Mozilla’s) implementation of the language. 
- ECMA — the European Computer Manufacturer’s Association.Intially it was known as "ECMAScript".
- The easiest way to run JavaScript is to open up the web developer tools in your web browser (with F12, Ctrl-Shift-I, or Command-Option-I) and select
  the Console tab.

```
If you want to see that same message printed out in the JavaScript console of a web browser, create a new file named hello.html, and put this text in it:
<script src="hello.js"></script>
Then load hello.html into your web browser using a file:// URL like this one:
file:///Users/username/javascript/hello.html
Open the developer tools window to see the greeting in the console.
```
