## Loops

Loops are used to iterate through a piece of code.
There are 3 types of loops : 
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while loop


## For loop
iterate through fixed number of times and number of iteration is known.

```
<script>
for(let i = 0; i<=5; i++){
    console.log(i)
}
</script>
```

## while loop
as long as the condition is true it will iterate. iteration is unknow.

```
<script>
let i = 1
while(i<=5>){
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
</script>
```

## do while
do while is similar to while only difference is that do while will be execute oce whether condn is true or false.

```
<script>
let i = 1
do{
    console.log(i)
    i++
}while(i<=5>);
</script>
```
